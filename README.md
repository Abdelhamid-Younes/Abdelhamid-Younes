Passionate IT engineer, I am always looking for new challenges.
For a few years now, I've been focusing on **Linux System Administration** as well as **containerization technologies**, the path of DevOps with **Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, Configuration Management** and so on. I'm also working on learning contents of these same topics.  
If you want to discuss about it, feel free to contact me.
